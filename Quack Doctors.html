    <p>Basketball was invented in 1891 by James Naismith, a physical education instructor at the International YMCA Training School (now Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts. Naismith was tasked with creating a new indoor sport that would be less injury-prone than football. He devised a game with 13 original rules that was played with a soccer ball and two peach baskets nailed to the balcony of the school gym.</p>
    <p>The game quickly gained popularity in the United States and around the world. The first professional basketball league, the National Basketball League (NBL), was founded in 1898. The Basketball Association of America (BAA) was founded in 1946, and the two leagues merged in 1949 to form the National Basketball Association (NBA).</p>
    <p>The NBA quickly became the premier professional basketball league in the world. The league's popularity grew even further in the 1960s and 1970s with the emergence of superstars like Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. In the 1980s and 1990s, Michael Jordan became one of the most popular and successful athletes in the world, helping to fuel the NBA's global expansion.</p>
    <p>Today, the NBA is one of the most popular sports leagues in the world, with a global audience of over 1 billion people. The league's players are some of the highest-paid athletes in the world, and the NBA Finals is one of the most watched sporting events in the world.</p>
    <p>Basketball has also become a popular sport at the collegiate level. The NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, commonly known as March Madness, is one of the most popular sporting events in the United States. The tournament is known for its upsets and Cinderella runs, and it has produced some of the biggest stars in NBA history, including LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant.</p>
    <p>Basketball is also a popular sport at the international level. The FIBA World Championship, now known as the FIBA Basketball World Cup, has been held every four years since 1950. The Olympic Games have also featured basketball since 1936. The United States has been the dominant force in international basketball, winning the most medals at the Olympics and FIBA World Cups.</p>
