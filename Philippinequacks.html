</p>

    <p>In the Philippines, an albularyo is a "folk doctor" who treats patients with herbal remedies and age-old techniques like massage and hilot. When treating ailments, their services are either used as a first or a last resort. The albularyo's patient asserts that the practitioner possesses supernatural abilities that contemporary medicine does not offer. They are thought to be more reliable than practitioners of modern medicine because of this belief. In addition to using traditional medicine, the albularyo are also thought to use curses and black magic. </p>
<p> Rituals and prayers known as orasyon (from Spanish oracion) are used by albularyos to carry out their trade. Additionally, they employ mixtures made from plant materials including leaves, bark, roots, and oils like coconut oils. These medicinal plants are sought after using the pangalap method, and their decoctions are made using the pabukal method. </p>

<p> The albularyo may use rituals and prayers to ward off the spirit and tawas (alum) crystals to determine who is to blame for the patient's ailments. The albularyo may also use their own saliva and pieces of paper with writings. The albularyo uses tawas (alum) crystals to determine who is to blame for the patient's ailments.The albularyo may also use candle wax poured in water </p>
